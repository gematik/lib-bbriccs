== Using a HttpBClient
This tutorial is quite short and easy to understand, which is the basic idea of the {brick-rest-client-api}.

NOTE: to keep this focused on the API, the <<tutorial_rest_client_builders,instantiation of a concrete HttpBClient implementation>> is shown in a separate tutorial.

Let's demonstrate the {brick-rest-client-api} by the example:

[source,java]
----
HttpBClient client = fromSomewhere();

HttpBRequest request = HttpBRequest.post()
  .urlPath("/v1/fd/pingpong")
  .headers(
      HttpHeader.accept(MediaType.ANY_TYPE),
      HttpHeader.forContentType(MediaType.PLAIN_TEXT_UTF_8))
  .withPayload("Hello World");

HttpBResponse response = client.send(request);
int status = response.statusCode();
String payload = response.bodyAsString();
String contentType = response.contentType();
----

That's basically it. This approach is very simple, but extremely powerful. Dive into the next tutorials to learn how to use it for more complex scenarios.

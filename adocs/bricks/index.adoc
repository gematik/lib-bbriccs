Within {bbriccs-wordmark}, the core modules are referred to as a `brick`. Each `brick` is a small, reusable component that solves a common problem. A group of such components, which together can solve a larger problem, are simply called `bricks`. This documentation follows this pattern and presents each group of `bricks` individually.

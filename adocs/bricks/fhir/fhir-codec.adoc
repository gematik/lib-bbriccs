== FHIR Codec Brick
So far we have only covered the creation and handling of FHIR objects. We have deliberately left out the aspect of serialisation. This is where the {brick-fhir-codec} comes into action.

A https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Codec[codec] is a component that encodes and decodes a data stream or signal. And a `FhirCodec` in the {bricks-fhir} ecosystem is a component that can encode and decode FHIR objects.

In addition to a normal codec, the `FhirCodec` is able to validate the correctness of the FHIR objects by delegating a `ValidatorFhir`. This topic will be covered in the <<fhir-validation-brick>>.

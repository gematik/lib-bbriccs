:warning-noticed-bug: {warning-caption} Have you spotted the issues in this small code snippet? Don't worry, the compiler wouldn't either, but a validator would notice that immediately.

:brick-intro-01: The FHIR standard is a set of rules and specifications for the exchange of health care data. It is designed to be flexible and adaptable, so that it can be used in a wide range of settings and with different health care information systems. Unfortunately, this flexibility can also make it difficult to work with HAPI. Thise comes primarily from the "being a general-purpose-library" nature of HAPI. Conversely, however, this also means that a consistent and maintainable usage across different projects and teams can be very challenging.

== Einleitung
{bbriccs-wordmark} (`briks`) offers reusable building bricks for flexible and maintainable test suites based on clean code principles.

=== Acronym
While {bbriccs-wordmark} is merely the word mark and is rather unwieldy in everyday use,
the following uses are recommended depending on the situation:

- Pronunciation: simply `briks` based on the idea clamping blocks
- Spelling: in the simplest case just `bricks` or `bbriccs` as a mnemonic for the word mark
- Code: the spelling `bbriccs` is only to be used for package names and namespaces, while `brick` (or `bricks` for plural) shall be used for variable, class or module names

=== Motivation
Within {orgname}, many of the products developed have a very similar technology stack.

{bbriccs-wordmark} provides a modular construction kit for the implementation of test suites and test tools, which simplifies the reuse of test code and the creation of test suites.

Thanks to the modular design, test suites can be assembled from existing modules and adapted to the respective requirements.
